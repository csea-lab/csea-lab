% path to a file with single trial EEG, "matfilepath" 
% path to a file with trial indices of good trials, "igfilepath"
% a plotflag (1 or 0 ) to plot output (1) or not (0)
% one of the following "featureflags" which select a predictor that is
% related (correlated) with the single trial SSVEP amplitude. 
%
% with these inputs, the correlation between the predictor and SSVEP is computed for all sensors, 
% and for that subject. 
% Can be looped over subjects.
% Outputs: 
% predictor: the predictor for each trial
% trialssVEP :The visual cortical response for each trial
% corrmat: a matrix of the correlation between the two
