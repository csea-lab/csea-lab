function [ampout3d, phaseout3d, freqs] = FFT_spectrum3D_singtrial(Data3d, timewinSP, SampRate, baselineSP)
% Applies baseline correction and single-trial FFT to 3D EEG data.
%
% Inputs:
% - Data3d: 3D matrix [channels x timepoints x trials]
% - timewinSP: indices of timepoints to use for FFT (e.g., 961:1861 for 0â€“1500 ms)
% - SampRate: sampling rate in Hz (e.g., 600)
% - baselineSP: indices of timepoints to use for baseline correction (e.g., 601:960 for -600 to 0 ms)
%
% Outputs:
% - ampout3d: amplitude spectrum [channels x frequencies x trials]
% - phaseout3d: phase spectrum [channels x frequencies x trials]
% - freqs: frequency vector in Hz

% Compute frequency resolution and frequency vector

    % === Extract trial data ===
    trial_data = squeeze(Data3d(:, :, trial));  % size: [channels x timepoints]
    
    % === Baseline correction ===
    baseline = mean(trial_data(:, baselineSP), 2);   % average across selected baseline timepoints
    trial_data = trial_data - baseline;              % subtract baseline from all timepoints
    
    % === Select time window for FFT ===
    Data = trial_data(:, timewinSP);  % subset for FFT
    
    % === Apply Hanning window ===
    Data = Data .* cosinwin(20, size(Data,2), size(Data,1));  % apply cosine window
    
    % === Perform FFT ===
    NFFT = size(Data, 2);
