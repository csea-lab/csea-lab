%% LB3: prepare (shrink) layout coordinates
%%% function to prepare coordinates (3D) and "shrink" them into cubes so that these cubes as coordinates can be 
%%% later put into LB3_findclusters as input to run clusterbased permutation (based on BWconncomp)
%%%
%%% needs as input: 
% 1) sensor net/coordinates (XZY), e.g., sfp file
%%% output:
% 1) cube_coords (for LB3_findcluster)
% 2) outfactor r (shrinkage/growth)
